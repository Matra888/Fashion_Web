      <!-- Body Type Summary -->
      <p>
        The inverted triangle body type is characterized by broad shoulders, a
        wider upper body, and a narrower waist and hips. This body shape often
        has athletic or muscular features. To enhance your figure, focus on
        creating a balanced silhouette. Choose clothing that adds volume to your
        lower body, such as A-line skirts and wide-leg pants. Avoid shoulder
        pads or overly embellished tops that accentuate your shoulders.
      </p>
      <!-- Body Type Examples -->
      <p>
        Some famous celebrities with an inverted triangle body type include Demi
        Moore, Naomi Campbell, and Renee Zellweger.

      <h3>Fashion Tips for Inverted Triangle Body Type</h3>
      <!-- # Fashion Tip # -->
      <h4>Balance proportions</h4>

        <p>
          The key to dressing an inverted triangle body type is to
          <strong>create balance</strong> between the upper and lower body.
          Choose clothing styles that
          <strong>add volume to the lower body</strong> while downplaying the
          broad shoulders.

      <h4>Tops</h4>
      <div class="fashion-tip">
        <img
          class="article-image"
          src="./assets/Focus_Inverted Triangle.png"
          alt="inverted triangle body type focus area"
        />
        <p>
          Opt for tops that
          <strong>draw attention away from the shoulders</strong>. V-necklines
          and scoop necks are flattering as they
          <strong>create a vertical line and elongate the torso</strong>. Avoid
          high-neck tops, boat necks, or any styles that emphasize the
          shoulders.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- # Fashion Tip # -->
      <h4>Bottoms</h4>
      <p>
        Choose bottoms that add volume to the hips and create a curvier
        silhouette. A-line skirts, flared pants, and wide-leg trousers can help
        achieve this. Patterns and details on the lower body can also help draw
        attention downward.
      </p>
      <!-- # Fashion Tip # -->
      <h4>Layering</h4>
      <p>
        Experiment with layering to create visual interest and balance. Wearing
        a jacket or cardigan that falls below the hips can help add volume to
        the lower body and create a more proportionate look.
      </p>
      <!-- # Fashion Tip # -->
      <h4>Belts</h4>
      <p>
        Cinch the waist with a belt to create definition and enhance an
        hourglass shape. This will help balance the broad shoulders and draw
        attention to the waistline.
      </p>
      <!-- # Fashion Tip # -->
      <h4>Colors and Patterns</h4>
      <p>
        Use color strategically to create balance. Darker shades on the upper
        body can help minimize the broadness, while lighter or brighter colors
        on the lower body can draw attention downward. Avoid bold patterns or
        details on the shoulders.
      </p>
      <!-- What to Avoid -->
      <h3>What to avoid</h3>
      <h4>Tops with Exaggerated Shoulder Details</h4>
      <p>
        Avoid tops with prominent shoulder details such as puff sleeves,
        ruffles, or shoulder pads. These can make the shoulders appear wider and
        further emphasize the top-heavy silhouette.
      </p>
      <h4>Halter Tops</h4>
      <p>
        Halter tops can accentuate the broadness of the shoulders and draw
        attention to the upper body. It's best to choose tops with different
        necklines that create a more balanced look.
      </p>

      <h4>High-Neck Dresses</h4>
      <p>
        Similar to high-neck tops, dresses with high necklines like turtlenecks
        or boat necks can emphasize the broadness of the shoulders. Opt for
        dresses with V-necks, scoop necks, or sweetheart necklines to create a
        more flattering silhouette.
      </p>
      <h4>Oversized or Shapeless Tops</h4>
      <p>
        Loose-fitting or shapeless tops can add bulk to the upper body and make
        the shoulders appear broader. Instead, choose tops that define your
        waist or have some structure to create a more balanced look.
      </p>

      <h4>Skinny Straps</h4>
      <p>
        Thin spaghetti straps or delicate shoulder straps can make the shoulders
        look wider in comparison. Opt for tops and dresses with thicker straps
        or even halter necklines to create a more proportionate appearance.
      </p>
      <h4>Skinny Jeans or Tapered Pants</h4>
      <p>
        Avoid skinny jeans or pants with a tapered leg as they can make the
        lower body appear smaller in proportion to the broad shoulders. Instead,
        opt for straight-leg or wide-leg trousers to add volume and balance to
        the lower body.
