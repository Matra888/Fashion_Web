          <h3>Don't</h3>
          Tops with Exaggerated Shoulder Details: Avoid tops with prominent shoulder details such as puff sleeves, ruffles, or shoulder pads. These can make the shoulders appear wider and further emphasize the top-heavy silhouette.
          Halter Tops: Halter tops can accentuate the broadness of the shoulders and draw attention to the upper body. It's best to choose tops with different necklines that create a more balanced look.
          High-Neck Dresses: Similar to high-neck tops, dresses with high necklines like turtlenecks or boat necks can emphasize the broadness of the shoulders. Opt for dresses with V-necks, scoop necks, or sweetheart necklines to create a more flattering silhouette.
          Oversized or Shapeless Tops: Loose-fitting or shapeless tops can add bulk to the upper body and make the shoulders appear broader. Instead, choose tops that define your waist or have some structure to create a more balanced look.
          Skinny Straps: Thin spaghetti straps or delicate shoulder straps can make the shoulders look wider in comparison. Opt for tops and dresses with thicker straps or even halter necklines to create a more proportionate appearance.
          Skinny Jeans or Tapered Pants: Avoid skinny jeans or pants with a tapered leg as they can make the lower body appear smaller in proportion to the broad shoulders. Instead, opt for straight-leg or wide-leg trousers to add volume and balance to the lower body.

          <h3>Do</h3>
          Balance Proportions: The key to dressing an inverted triangle body
          type is to create balance between the upper and lower body. Choose
          clothing styles that add volume to the lower body while downplaying
          the broad shoulders. Tops: Opt for tops that draw attention away from
          the shoulders. V-necklines and scoop necks are flattering as they
          create a vertical line and elongate the torso. Avoid high-neck tops,
          boat necks, or any styles that emphasize the shoulders. Bottoms:
          Choose bottoms that add volume to the hips and create a curvier
          silhouette. A-line skirts, flared pants, and wide-leg trousers can
          help achieve this. Patterns and details on the lower body can also
          help draw attention downward. Layering: Experiment with layering to
          create visual interest and balance. Wearing a jacket or cardigan that
          falls below the hips can help add volume to the lower body and create
          a more proportionate look. Belts: Cinch the waist with a belt to
          create definition and enhance an hourglass shape. This will help
          balance the broad shoulders and draw attention to the waistline.
          Colors and Patterns: Use color strategically to create balance. Darker
          shades on the upper body can help minimize the broadness, while
          lighter or brighter colors on the lower body can draw attention
          downward. Avoid bold patterns or details on the shoulders.
